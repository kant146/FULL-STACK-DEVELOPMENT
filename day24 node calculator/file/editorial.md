Create a new Node.js project and initialize it with npm.

Create a new file called "index.js" and use the built-in "process.argv" property to retrieve the command line arguments passed to the script.

Use a switch statement or if-else statement to check the first argument (operation) and perform the appropriate calculation based on the remaining arguments.

For the random number generation, use the built-in crypto module and its "randomBytes()" method to generate a random number of the desired length (if provided as an argument).

Finally, use console.log() to output the result of the calculation.

It's important to handle cases where the wrong number of arguments or invalid operations are passed.

Don't forget to add comments throughout your code to explain the logic behind each step.
